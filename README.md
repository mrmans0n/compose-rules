> **Note**
> This project started as a fork of [Twitter Jetpack Compose Rules](https://github.com/twitter/compose-rules) by the original rules maintainer, as the development on the original repository stopped. The development of the rules will continue here from now on. If you are migrating from that project, check out the [migration guide](https://mrmans0n.github.io/compose-rules/).

## Overview

It can be challenging for big teams to start adopting Compose, particularly because not everyone will start at same time or with the same patterns. We tried to ease the pain by creating a set of Compose static checks.

Compose has lots of superpowers but also has a bunch of footguns to be aware of [as seen in this Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/mrmans0n/status/1507390768796909571).

This is where our static checks come in. We want to detect as many potential issues as we can, as quickly as we can. In this case we want an error to show prior to engineers having to review code. Similar to other static check libraries we hope this leads to a "don't shoot the messengers" philosphy which will foster healthy Compose adoption.

## What custom rules are bundled in this repo?

You can find the comprehensive list of rules in [the rules documentation](https://mrmans0n.github.io/compose-rules/rules). It contains both the what and why for each rule, we encourage you to read it prior to adopting our rules.

There are 2 ways you can add these static checks to your build - using ktlint or using detekt.

## Using with ktlint

You can refer to the [Using with ktlint](https://mrmans0n.github.io/compose-rules/ktlint) documentation.

## Using with detekt

You can refer to the [Using with detekt](https://mrmans0n.github.io/compose-rules/detekt) documentation.

We love sharing and learning from others; contributing new rules or fixes is welcome. See the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) instructions for more information.
